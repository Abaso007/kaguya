# Kaguya

Kaguya is a ChatGPT plugin that allows you to load and edit your local files in a controlled way, as well as run any Python, JavaScript, and bash script. This makes it a powerful tool for developers, enabling them to interact with their file system and run scripts directly from ChatGPT. To interact with Kaguya through ChatGPT, you'll need access to ChatGPT plugin devtools by getting on their waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/plugins). In case this approach doesn't work for you, we may be able to come up with a more open approach at some point in the future.

## Demo

Here are the demo videos of Kaguya:

1. Gain access to OpenAI's plugin devtools for ChatGPT [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/plugins)
1. Install Docker
1. Execute ```docker.sh``` script
1. Setup localhost port 3000
1. Interact with Kaguya through ChatGPT

## API Endpoints

The project provides several API endpoints that allow you to interact with the file system. The API is described in the `openapi.yaml` file. Here is a brief overview:

- `POST /api/executeCommand`: Execute a shell command.
- `GET /api/listFilesInDirectory`: List files and directories in the specified directory. Defaults to FILES.
- `GET /api/readFile`: Read the content of a file in the user's directory.
- `POST /api/update`: Update a file in the user's directory by performing a search-and-replace operation.
- `POST /api/updateAll`: Update a file in the user's directory by performing a search-and-replace operation (all occurrences).
- `POST /api/updateWholeFile`: Replace the entire content of a file in the user's directory.
- `POST /api/createFile`: Create a new file.
- `POST /api/deleteFile`: Delete a file in the user's directory.
- `POST /api/renameFile`: Rename a file in the user's directory.
- `POST /api/appendToFile`: Append content to the end of an existing file.
- `POST /api/createDirectory`: Create a new directory.
- `POST /api/deleteDirectory`: Delete a directory and its contents.
- `POST /api/readMultipleFiles`: Read the content of multiple files.

## Tips

- If listFilesInDirectory tries to show too many files, a good solution would be to add a git repo or submodule, in which files in .gitignore are ignored.
- Best to keep each file under 100 lines of code, particularly for writing
- Writing more than ~80 lines of code at once is not recommended. It's slow and it might not even be able to finish the task.
- You can have it read more code though. However, reading more than 500-600 lines of code at once is not recommended.
- If the target file you want to edit is long, you may want to explicitly ask it to use search and replace and NOT updateWholeFile.
- It may not get the intention of your instructions right away. It's meant to be a conversational tool.
- If the assistant starts hallucinating, it may be helpful to start a new conversation or limit the length of each file being loaded.
